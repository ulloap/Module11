# Module11

## Part 1
Part 1 of the challenge showcases my skills such as successfully importing python libraries, opening 'Chrome' and navigating to the url link, as well as parsing through the website to extract the text elements by calling for the correct tag and class. A for loop was created in order to extract the title and preview of each element, and it was appended to an empty list in order to view.

## Part 2
Part 2 of the challenge I demonstrate my skills using Splinter, bs4, matplotlib, and Pandas. I connected to the URL and parsed through the website using Broser and BeautifulSoup. A dataframe for the website was constructed, and columns were renamed, as well as changing the data type to the corresponding data type. Matplotlib was used in order to create graphs portaying changes in temperature/air pressure over time. A CSV file was saved ane exported from the dataframe.

## Table of Contents
My Part 1 and Part code will be found inside of "Module11" folder, as well as the CSV file named "mars_weather" from part 2, along with the ReadMe file. Starter_Code 2 folder will hold the original worksheets, in which I worked right off of.

## Credits
I would like to credit ChatGPT, as it helped me figure out how to appropiately write certain codes that I felt stuck on, such as creating my graphs, and changing my data types correctly. I would also like to give credit to our TAs and AskBCS Learning Assistant, as they helped guide me with questions and troubleshooting.
